While working on this Jenkins pipeline, I got a good hang of how to set up and run a basic pipeline job using the Jenkins interface. I checked out the dashboard, build queue, and stage view to see how things flow. Watching each stage run and checking the logs gave me a clear idea of whatâ€™s happening behind the scenes. Adding a new stage was simple and showed me how flexible pipelines are. Overall, it was a good hands-on way to get comfortable with Jenkins and how it handles automation.
